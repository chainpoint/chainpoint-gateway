See [Chainpoint Start](https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint-start) for an overview of the Chainpoint Network.

A Chainpoint Gateway is a dedicated server for generating many Chainpoint proofs with a single request to the Chainpoint Network.

Each Gateway has an integrated Lightning Node running [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd). Gateways use [Lightning Service Authentication Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lsat-js) (LSATs) to pay Cores an `anchor fee` when submitting a Merkle root. The default anchor fee is 2 [satoshis](<https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit)>). Core operators can set their `anchor fee` to adapt to changing market conditions, and compete to receive transactions from Gateways

Gateway setup takes 45 - 90 mins, due to activities that require the automated setup tools to interact with the Bitcoin Blockchain.

- Lightning Node sync (10 - 15 minutes)
- Funding the Lightning wallet and waiting for 3 confirmations (avg 30 mins)

## Installation

### Requirements

The following software is required:

- `*Nix-based OS (Ubuntu Linux and MacOS have been tested)`
- `BASH`
- `Git`
- `Docker`

A BASH script to install all other dependencies (make, openssl, nodejs, yarn) on Ubuntu and Mac can be run from `make install-deps`.

Chainpoint Gateway has been tested with different hardware configurations.

Minimum:

- `4GB RAM`
- `1 CPU Cores`
- `128+ GB SSD`
- `Public IPv4 address`

Mid-Range:

- `8GB RAM`
- `2 CPU Cores`
- `256+ GB SSD`
- `Public IPv4 address`

### Deployment

Run the following commands to initiate your Gateway:

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install make git
$ git clone https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint-gateway.git
$ cd chainpoint-gateway
$ make install-deps

Logout and login to allow your user to use Docker

$ exit
```

#### Configure Gateway

```
$ ssh user@<your_ip>
$ cd chainpoint-gateway
$ make init

#### Initialize Lightning

```
Initializing Lightning wallet...
Create new address for wallet...
Creating Docker secrets...
****************************************************
Lightning initialization has completed successfully.
****************************************************
Lightning Wallet Password: kPlIshurrduurSQoXa
LND Wallet Seed: absorb behind drop safe like herp derp celery galaxy wait orient sign suit castle awake gadget pass pipe sudden ethics hill choose six orphan
Lightning Wallet Address:tb1qglvlrlg0velrserjuuy7s4uhrsrhuzwgl8hvgm
******************************************************
You should back up this information in a secure place.
******************************************************

TODO: REMOVE Please fund the Lightning Wallet Address above with Bitcoin and wait for 6 confirmations before running 'make deploy'

How many Cores would you like to connect to? (max 4) 2
Would you like to specify any Core IPs manually? No

You have chosen to connect to 2 Core(s).
You will now need to fund you wallet with a minimum amount of BTC to cover costs of the initial channel creation and future Core submissions.

? How many Satoshi to commit to each channel/Core? (min 120000) 500000
? 500000 per channel will require 1000000 Satoshi total funding. Is this OK? (Y/n) y

**************************************************************************************************************
Please send 1000000 Satoshi (0.01 BTC) to your wallet with address tb1qglvlrlg0velrserjuuy7s4uhrsrhuzwgl8hvgm
**************************************************************************************************************

This initialization process will now wait until your Lightning node is fully synced and your wallet is funded with at least 400000 Satoshi. The init process should resume automatically.

*****************************************
Your Lightning node is fully synced.
*****************************************

***********************************************
Your Lightning wallet is adequately funded.
***********************************************

*********************************************************************************
Chainpoint Gateway and integrated Lightning node have been successfully initialized.
*********************************************************************************

$ make deploy
```

After running `make deploy`, the Gateway will automatically peer and open Lightning channels with Cores. This may take up to 6 confirmations (~60 minutes). This will allow the Gateway to authenticate with Cores and pay for Anchor Fees. This process may take several minutes upon first run.

## Troubleshooting

If your issue isn't addressed here, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint-core/issues) to the Chainpoint Core repo.

### Init Problems

If `make init` fails and the Lightning wallet hasn't yet been generated and funded, run `make init-restart`, then run `make init` again. If the Lightning wallet has already been generated and funded, you can usually just run `make init` again to continue the initialization process.

### Docker Secrets

Gateway uses docker secrets to store sensitive credentials. If you receive a `secret not found` error for either `HOT_WALLET_PASS` or `HOT_WALLET_ADDRESS` while deploying, this can be remedied by using your saved lnd credentials to recreate the secrets:
`printf <hot wallet password without quotes> | docker secret create HOT_WALLET_PASS -` or `printf <hot wallet address without quotes> | docker secret create HOT_WALLET_ADDRESS -`.

## Gateway Public API

Every Gateway provides a public HTTP API. This is documented in greater detail on the [Gateway HTTP API wiki](https://github.com/chainpoint/chainpoint-gateway/wiki/Gateway-HTTP-API)
